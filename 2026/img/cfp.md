## Objectives & Topics  

### Background  
 As artificial intelligence and intelligent user interfaces (IUIs) reshape healthcare, new opportunities emerge to improve engagement, personalization, accessibility, and trust in health systems.  Health IUIs form the bridge between algorithms and people, determining the quality of interaction and enabling meaningful collaboration. Health IUIs must balance technological innovation with user needs, domain demands, ethical considerations, and long-term health and care challenges across diverse populations, from patients managing chronic conditions to clinicians and caregivers, and across diverse health systems worldwide.

### Goals  
The HealthIUI 2026 Workshop aims to bring together an interdisciplinary community from HCI, AI, healthcare, psychology, and rehabilitation sciences to:  
- Explore innovative health IUIs that foster long-term engagement and personalization.  
- Address challenges of value-centric design, ethics, privacy, fairness, and inclusion in intelligent health technologies.
- Share research findings, datasets, tools, systems, and evaluation methods.  
- Build collaborations that advance human-centered, intelligent health technologies.  

### Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to:  
- Personalized Health Interfaces and Interventions  
- Adaptive Systems for Patient Engagement and Education  
- AI-driven Health Information Presentation and Recommender Systems  
- Multimodal and Conversational Interaction for Health & Care  
- Intelligent Interfaces for Chronic Disease Management  
- Assistive & Accessible IUIs for Older Adults or Populations with Limited Tech Access  
- Ethical, Privacy, and Trust Considerations in Health IUIs  
- Wearables and Sensor-based Health Interfaces  
- Rehabilitation and Cognitive Support Technologies  
- Equitable & Inclusive Design for Marginalized Populations  
- Longitudinal Studies and Real-world Evaluations of Health IUIs  
- Human-AI Collaboration in Clinical and Care Contexts  
- Intelligent Interfaces for Health and Care, Behavior Change, and Well-being
